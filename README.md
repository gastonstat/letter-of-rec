# So you want me to write you a letter of recommendation

You should know upfront that most of the time I decline writing letters of 
recommendation. My two main reasons for doing this are:

1) __I don't know you enough__: I haven't known you long enough to get an 
accurate idea of your qualifications and skills to endorse you.

2) __I don't have time__: I'm already too busy with my teaching responsibilities, 
and with my personal life outside academia.

With that said, you can come to my OH, and if I'm not busy helping other
students, we can talk about your intentions, wishes and dreams for 
going to grad school. While I may not help you with a letter-of-rec, 
I'm confident that I can _add my 2 cents_ and enrich your framework
about your intentions to go to grad school.

For example, we can talk about one or more of the following topics.



### Why do you want to go to grad school?

Is it because of:

- love and passion about a certain knowledge domain
- career advancement
- career change
- peer pressure
- family pressure
- society pressure
- cannot find job
- pie-in-the-sky dream
- don't have a clear idea of next step in life



### What is the expected professional future after grad school?

- Do you know what kind of "typical" jobs are available after finishing grad school?
- Do you know how hard/easy it is to find jobs after finishing grad school?
- Have you talked to people making a living in that domain/discipline?
	+ Have you asked them what would they do different if they were to start again?


### Have you considered postponing going to grad school?

- What is your opportunity cost for going to grad school?
- Have you considered going to industry for a couple of years before applying to grad school?
- Have you considered going to industry instead of grad school?
- Have you considered taking some time off academia before going to grad school?
- Is this the best time for you to go to grad school?
	+ Do you have other responsibilities?
	+ Do you have other commitments?
	+ Do you have other alternatives?	
	+ Do you have other options?



### Do you have a plan B, C, D, ...?

Do you have a backup plan if:

- you can't attend grad school?
- you were to find that grad school is not for you?
- you need or were forced to quit grad school?



### Do you know how much is going to cost you?
	
How much---on average---are you going to pay (e.g. every week, every month, every semester, every year) for:

- education?
- housing?
- utilities?
- food?
- transportation?
- healthcare?
- entertainment?
- other?



### How are you going to cover the costs?

- Will your family cover all the expenses?
- Will your family cover some of the expenses?
- Will you have to find a part-time (or full-time) job?
- Will you have to get student loans?
	+ how much money should you borrow?
	+ at what interest rate?
	+ what the payment schedule could look like? Run an amortization calculator to get a rough idea
- Will you have to apply for scholarships, grants, funds?
- Will you consider more affordable schools/programs?
